##  GNUton's Asus Merlin changelog  ##

Date: January 11, 2025
Release: 3004.388.8_4-gnuton1

  - CHANGED: VPN killswitch will now only be active if the
             VPN client itself is enabled.  If you stop/start
             the client yourself over SSH, you need to also
             update the enabled/disabled nvram setting.
  - FIXED: Security issues in AiCloud (backports from Asus)
  - FIXED: CVE-2024-2511, CVE-2024-4741, CVE-2024-5535 &
           Implicit rejection for RSA PKCS#1 in openssl
           (backport from Ubuntu by RSDNTWK)
